Hello, this is a project for CMSC447.
The purpose of this project is to be a storyboard that authors can use to write mysteries and build clues.
The first iteration I (Tony Cruz) worked on the login/sign-up page for the storyboard site.
A majority of my time was spent researching django applications and reading through tutorials.

Testing: the test for this project so far is done manually by the user. This can be done by running the login page application
    using the steps below and creating an account/logging in.

Steps to locally host app:
1) run the line "Pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal to download dependencies
2) cd into the MysteryInc/loginPage/ directory
3) run the line "python manage.py runserver" in the terminal to stand up web page
4) in a web browser enter the url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/" and proceed with testing the application

Steps to run tests:
1) make sure you're in a bash terminal
2) give executable permissions to tests.sh
3) run the tests.sh bash script with the following command => ./tests.sh
4) If you don't have a bash terminal you can run the command in powershell from MysteryInc dir => ./mysite/manage.py test tests.MySeleniumTests.test_site
